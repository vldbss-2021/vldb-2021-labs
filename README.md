    - [Lab4 C](./tinysql/doc_ss/lab4c-README-zh_CN.md), implement select and projection executor.

## Autograding

Autograding is a workflow which can automatically run test cases. In order to make golang works and run it in our self-hosted machines, **you need to overwrite the workflow generated by Github classroom**.

```sh
cp scripts/classroom.yml .github/workflows/classroom.yml
```
